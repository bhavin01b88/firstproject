	<h4>OPERATORS</h4>
	<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the computer to perform certain mathematical or logical manipulation.It can operate on 
	integer,character and real numbers.Python operators can be classified into various categories based on their utility and action.They include-</p>
	<p>1.Arithmetic Operators<br>2.Relational operators<br>3.Logical Operators<br>4.Assignment Operators<br>5.Increment or Decrement operators<br>
	6.Conditional Operators<br>7.Bitwise Operators<p>
	<h5>Arithmetic Operators</h5>
	<p>The arithmetic operator perform arithmetic operation and can be classified into unary and binary arithmetic operator.
	The arithmetic operator can operate on any built-in data type.A list of arithmetic operator and their meaning are given below-</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Operator</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>+</td>
    <td>Addition or Unary plus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>Subtraction or Unary minus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>*</td>
    <td>Multiplication</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/</td>
    <td>Division</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>%</td>
    <td>Modulo division(reminder after division)</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
	<p><b>Integer arithmetic</b>-When two operands such as a and b are declared integers,an arithmetic operation performed on these
	integer is called integer arithmetic.It always yields an integer value.For example,if a and b are integers,then for a=14 and 
	b=4,the results are-</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<pre>
		a-b=10
		a+b=18
		a*b=56
		a/b=3
		a%b=2(remainder of division)
	</pre>
	</div>
	<p>During integer division,if both the operands are of the same sign,the results is truncated towards zero.If one of them is negative
	the direction of truncation is implementation dependent.That is, 6/8=0 and -6/-8=0 but -6/8 may be zero or -1</p>
	<p><b>Floating Point/Real Arithmetic</b>-An arithmetic operation involving only real operands is called real arithmetic.A real
	operand may assume value either in decimal or exponential notation.The floating point results are rounded off to the number of significant
	digit specified and hence the final value is only an approximation of the correct results.The operator % cannot be used with real operands.
	For example,if p,q and r are floats,then-</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<pre>
		p=6.0/7.0=.857143
		q=1.0/3.0=.333333
		r=-2.0/3.0=.666667
	</pre>
	</div>
	<p><b>Mixed Mode Arithmetic</b>-In mixed mode arithmetic,if either of the operand is real,the resultant is always a real value.Foe example,</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<pre>
		15/10=1.5
	</pre>
	</div>
	<h5>Relational Operators</h5>
	<p>Relational operators are used to compares arithmetic,logical and character expression.We often compares two similar 
	quantities and depending on their relation,take some decisions.These comparison can be done with the help of relational operators.
	Each of these operators compares their left hand side with their right hand side.The whole expression involving the relational operator
	then evaluates to an integers.It evalute to zero if the condition is false and 1 if it is true.</p> 
	<div id="shadow">
	<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Operator</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><</td>
    <td>Less than</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>></td>
    <td>Greater than</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><=</td>
    <td>Less than or equal to</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>>=</td>
    <td>Greater than or equal to</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>==</td>
    <td>Equal to</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>!=</td>
	<td>Not equal to</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
  <h5>Logical Operators</h5>
  <p>A logical operator is used to compare or evaluate logical or relational expression.There are three
	logical operators.They are-</p>  
	<div id="shadow">
	<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Operator</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&&</td>
    <td>Logical AND</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>||</td>
    <td>Logical OR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>!</td>
    <td>Logical NOT</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
  <p>An expression involving && or || sometimes called logical expression or compound expression.A logical expression also yields 
  a value of one or zero.</p>
  <p><b>Logical AND</b>-Consider the following example</p>
  <div id="shadow">
  <pre>
	a>b&&x==10
  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>This expression evaluates to true(1) only if both expression,a>b and x==10,are true.</p>
  <p><b>Logical OR</b>-Consider the following example,</p>
  <div id="shadow">
  <pre>
	a&ltn||a&ltn
  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>This expression is true if one of them is true,or if both of them are true</p>
  <p><b>Logical NOT</b>-The !(NOT) operator takes a single expression and evaluates to true(1) if the expression is false(zero)
  and evaluates to false(0) if the expression is true.In other words,it just reverses the value of the expression.For example</p>
  <div id="shadow">
  <pre>
	!(x>=y)
	</pre>
	</div>
	<p>In this expression evaluates to true only if the value of x is neither greater main nor equal to y.Therefore the whole expression
	including the ! operator is the same as-x<y</p>
	<h5>Assignment Operators</h5>
	<p>Assignment operator(=)are used to assign the result of an expression to a variable.Python has a set of shorthand assignment operator
	of the form,v op=exp; where v is a variable exp is an expression and op is a Python binary arithmetic operator.The operator op- is knoen
	as a shorthand assignment operator.The assignment statement<br>vop=exp; is equivalent to<br>v=v op(exp);<br>with v evaluated only once.
	For example<br>x+=y+1; This is same as the statement<br>x=x+(y+1); Some of the commonly used shorthand operators are-</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<table>
  <tr>
    <th>statement with the simple operator</th>
    <th>statement with shorthand assignment operator</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a=a+1;</td>
    <td>a+=1;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a=a-1;</td>
    <td>a-=1;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a=a*(n+1);</td>
    <td>a*=n+1;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a=a/(n+1)</td>
    <td>a/=n+1;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a=a%b;</td>
    <td>a%=b;</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
	<h5>Increment or Decrement Operators</h5>
	<p>The increment and decrement operator are very useful in Python language.The syntex of the operator is given below-</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<pre>
		++&ltvariable name&gt
		--&ltvariable name&gt
		&ltvariable name&gt++
		&ltvariable name&gt--
	</pre>
	</div>
	<p>The operator ++ adds 1 to the operand and -- subtracts 1 from the append.Theseoperator come in two forms-<b>prefix</b> and
	<b>postfix</b>.For example,++ operator can be used in two ways: ++m and m++.</p> 
	<h5>Conditional Operator(Ternary Operator)</h5>
	<p>The conditional operator consists of two symbols-the question mark(?) and the colon(:).The syntex of ternary operator is<br>
	exp1? exp2: exp3; where exp1,exp2 and exp3 are expressions.</p>
	<p>The operator?: works as follow-exp1 is evaluated first.If it is nonzero(true0,then the expression 2 is evaluated and becomes 
	the value of the expression.Here, only one of the expression (either exp2 or exp3) is evaluated.For example</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<pre>
		a=10;
		b=15;
		x=(a>b)?a:b    Here,x will be assigned the value of b.
	</pre>
	</div>
	<h5>Bitwise Operator</h5>
	<p>A bitwise operator operates on each bit of data.These operators are used for testing,complementing or shifting bits to the 
	right or left.Bitwise operators may not be applied to float or double.A list of bitwise operators are given below-</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Operator</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&</td>
    <td>bitwise AND</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>|</td>
    <td>bitwise OR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>^</td>
    <td>bitwise XOR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><<</td>
    <td>shift left</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>>></td>
    <td>shift right</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>~</td>
	<td>bitwise complement</td>
