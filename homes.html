	<h2>LEARN PYTHON PROGRAMMING</h2>
	<p>Python is a powerful high-level, object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum.<br><br>
	It has simple easy-to-use syntax, making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for the first time.<br><br>
	This is a comprehensive guide on how to get started in Python, why you should learn it and how you can learn it. However,
	if you knowledge of other programming languages and want to quickly get started with Python, visit<a href="tutorial.html"> Python tutorial page.</a></p>
	<h4>What is Python (Programming Language)? - The Basics</h4>
	<p>Before getting started, lets get familiarized with the language first.<br><br>
	Python is a general-purpose language. It has wide range of applications from Web development (like: Django and Bottle), 
	scientific and mathematical computing (Orange, SymPy, NumPy) to desktop graphical user Interfaces (Pygame, Panda3D).<br><br>
	The syntax of the language is clean and length of the code is relatively short. It's fun to work in Python because
	it allows you to think about the problem rather than focusing on the syntax.</p>
	<h4>More information on Python Language:</h4>
	<h5>History of Python</h5>
	<p>Python is a fairly old language created by Guido Van Rossum. The design began in the late 1980s and was first released in February 1991.</p>
	<h5>Why Python was created?</h5>
	<p>In late 1980s, Guido Van Rossum was working on the Amoeba distributed operating system group. He wanted to use an interpreted language like ABC 
	(ABC has simple easy-to-understand syntax) that could access the Amoeba system calls. So, he decided to create a language that was extensible. 
	This led to design of a new language which was later named Python.</p>
	<h5>Why the name Python?</h5>
	<p>No. It wasn't named after a dangerous snake. Rossum was fan of a comedy series from late seventies. The name "Python" was adopted from the same series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".</p>
	<h4>Should You Learn Python programming</h4>
	<p>If only it were possible to answer this question with a simple “yes” or “no”. Unfortunately, it’s not an easy question to answer and varies from person to person.<br><br>
	Personally speaking, I love Python programming. It is a good language to start your programming journey if you are a newbie. Even if you are an experienced programmer, I recommend you to learn it at some point; it will certainly help.</p>
	<h5>What will you gain if you learn Python?</h5>
	<p>If you don’t know Python, you don’t know what you are doing as a programmer. Sure, your application works fine and all. But, if you can’t say why while (*s++ = *p++); copies a string, you’re programming on a superstition. ( Joel Spolsky’s words, not mine ).</p>
	<div id="list">
	<ol>
		<li>You will understand how a computer works.</li>
		<p>If you know Python, you will not only know how your program works but, you will be able to create a mental model on how a computer works (including memory management and allocation). You will learn to appreciate the freedom that Python provides unlike Python and Java.</p>
		<p>Understanding Python allows you to write programs that you never thought were possible before (or at the very least, you will have a broader understanding of computer architecture and programming as a whole).</p>
		<br>
		<li>Python is the lingua franca of programming.
		<p>Almost all high-level programming languages like Java, Python, JavaScript etc. can interface with Python programming. Also, it’s a good language to express common ideas in programming. Doesn’t matter if the person you are talking with doesn’t know Python, you can still convey your idea in a way they can understand.</p>
		<br>
		<li>Opportunity to work on open source projects that impact millions of people.
		<p>At first, you may overlook the fact that Python is an important language. If you need to develop a mobile app, you need Java (for Android), Swift and Objective Python (for iOS). And there are dozens of languages like Python#, PHP, ASP.net, Ruby, Python for building web application. Then, where is Python programming?</p>
		<p>Python is used for making wide range for applications. And, Python is used for making Python. If you want to contribute to Python, you need to know Python programming to work on Python interpreter that impacts millions of Python programmers. This is just one example. A large number of softwares that you use today is powered by Python.</p>
		<p>Some of the larger open source projects where Python programming is used are Linux Kernel, Python Interpreter, SQLite Database.</p>
		<p>Another language that’s commonly used for large open source project is Python. If you know Python, you can contribute to large open source projects that impacts hundreds of millions of people.</p>
		<br>
		<li>You will write better programs.
		<p>To be honest, this statement may not be true all the time. However, knowing how computer works and manage memory gives you insight on how to write efficient code in other programming languages.</p>
		<br>
		<li>You will find it much easier to learn other programming languages.
		<p>A lot of popular programming languages are based on Python, considered superset of Python programming with OOP features). If you know java, you will get a head start learning advance Python.</p>
		<p>Languages like C# and Java are related to Python. Also, the syntax of JavaScript and PHP is similar to Python.</p>
		<p>If you know Python programming, you will not have any problem switching to another language.</p>

	<h5>Reasons not to learn Python programming</h5>
	<p>You can create awesome softwares without knowing Python programming at all. Jeff Atwood, one of the creators of Stackoverflow.com, apparently doesn’t know Python and Stack Overflow is a really good web application.<br><br>
	If you are busy and don’t want to invest time on something that doesn’t have direct effect on your day-to-day work, Python programming is not for you.<br><br>
	Also, if you are a newbie and want to start learning programming with an easier language (Python is not the easiest of language to learn), you can start with Python.</p>
	<h5>Verdict on whether to learn Python programming or not</h5>
	<h5>For newbie:</h5>
	<p>For many, Python programming is the best language to start learning programming. However, if you want to start with an easier language which is clean and easier to grasp, go for Python.</p>
	<h5>For experienced programmers:</h5>
	<p>It’s not absolutely essential but there are perks of learning Python programming.<br><br>
	Don’t leave your current project immediately (I know you won’t) to learn Python. You can learn it when you have free time and want to expand your programming skills.<br><br>
	I believe, it’s not necessary to learn Python immediately. However, you should learn Python eventually.</p>
	
	<h4>The fun begins: Your first Python program</h4>
	<p>Often, a program called "Hello, World!" is used to introduce a new programming language to beginners. A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that outputs "Hello, World!".<br><br>
	However, Python is one of the easiest language to learn, and creating "Hello, World!" program is as simple as writing print("Hello, World!"). So, we are going to write a different program.</p>
	<h5>Program to Add Two Numbers</h5>
	<div id="shadow">
	<pre>
	#add two numbers
	num1 = 3
	num2 = 5
	sum = num1+num2
	print(sum)
	</pre>
	</div>
	<h5>How this program works?</h5>
	<p><b>Line 1:</b> # Add two numbers</p>
	<p>Any line starting with # in Python programming is a comment.</p>
	<p>Comments are used in programming to describe the purpose of the code. This helps you as well as other programmers to understand the intent of the code. Comments are completely ignored by compilers and interpreters.</p>
	<p><b>Line 2:</b> num1 = 3</p>
	<p>Here, num1 is a variable. You can store a value in a variable. Here, 3 is stored in this variable.</p>
	<p><b>Line 3:</b> num2 = 5</p>
	<p>Similarly, 5 is stored in num2 variable.</p>
	<p><b>Line 4:</b> sum = num1+num2</p>
	<p>The variables num1 and num2 are added using + operator. The result of addition is then stored in another variable sum.</p>
	<p><b>Line 5:</b> print(sum)</p>
	<p>The print() function prints the output to the screen. In our case, it prints 8 on the screen.</p>
	
	<h4>Key notes to take away</h4>
	<p>All Python program starts from the main() function and it’s mandatory.<br><br>
	You can use the required header file that’s necessary in the program. For example: To use sqrt() function to calculate square root and pow() function to find power of a number, you need to include math.h header file in your program.<br><br>
	Python is case-sensitive; the use of uppercase letter and lowercase letter have different meanings.<br><br>
	The Python program ends when the program encounters the return statement inside the main() function. However, return statement inside the main function is not mandatory.<br><br>
	The statement in a Python program ends with a semicolon.</p>
	
	<h4>Learn Python programming, the right way</h4>
	<p>Fact: You cannot learn Python programming in a day. You might have difficulty grasping the important concepts if you try to learn Python programming faster.<br><br>
	If you just learn the syntax and dive in, your Python code may work but you’ll not end up learning Python programming the right way., </p>
	<h5>Don’t just look at the example code, run it in your system</h5>
	<p>Programiz has dozens of examples that will help you understand Python programming. However, if you are reading it like a novel without running it in your system, you are doing it wrong.<br><br>
	If you want to learn a new feature of Python programming, try to write code related to that feature. If you can’t, copy code from Programiz and run it in your system. Then, try to understand it. Once you understand it, modify the code, make it different and run it again.</p>
	<h5>Learn to use a Debugging tool</h5>
	<p>A debugging tool or debugger is a software (that’s already available in IDE) which allows programmers to stop a program at any point and helps to detect and correct errors.<br><br>
	When you have bugs in your program, rather than scratching your head to find the bug, you can use debugger to stop program at any point and find the value of variables to detect the bug.<br><br>
	Knowing how to use a debugger is an important skill that every programmer should learn. </p>
	<h5>Learn the feature the way it is intended </h5>
	<p>Imagine a situation: It’s possible to solve a problem with an array. Also, you can solve the same problem with a structure. Technically both are correct, which method will you use?<br><br>
	To answer this question, you should have a good knowledge of when to use an array and when to use a structure.<br><br>
	Suppose, you are switching to Python from a different language, let’s say Python#. You do not want to write Python# style code with Python syntax in your Python program.</p>
	<h5>Join Python communities</h5>
	<p>Once you get the hang of writing simple Python programs, join online communities and forums. You can help other programmers where you can and ask for help when you are stuck. <br><br>
	Communities Programiz recommends you to join:<br><br>
	
	1.Private Google Forum For Python Programmer- It’s a gem for Python programming beginners.<br>
	2.Codechef-Practice questions, challenges and a large community of programmers<br>
	3.StackOverflow- Most Popular programming Q&A site on the web</p>
	
	<h5>Always follow good programming practice</h5>
	<p>Good programming practice are the informal rules which can improve quality and decrease development time of the software.<br><br>
	Some of the programming practices mentioned here are valid in all programming languages whereas some are valid only for Python programming. </p>
	<h5>Final Words</h5>
	<p>Python is a terrific language. The syntax is simple and code length is short which makes is easy to understand and write.<br><br>
	If you are getting started in programming, Python is an awesome choice. You will be amazed how much you can do in Python once you know the basics.<br><br>
	It's easy to overlook the fact that Python is a powerful language. Not only is it good for learning programming, it's also a good language to have in your arsenal. Change your idea into a prototype or create games or get started with data Science, 
	Python can help you in everything to get started.</p>
