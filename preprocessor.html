	<h4>The Python Preprocessor</h4>
	<p>The Python preprocessor is exactly what is name implies.It is a program that processes our source program before it is passed
	to the compiler.Preprocessor command (often known as directives) form what can almost be considered a language within Python 
	language.We can certainly write Python program without knowing anything about the preprocessor or its facilities.But preprocessor
	is such a great convenience that virtually all Python programmers rely on it.This page explore the Python preprocessor directives,and
	discusses the pros and cons of using them in program.</p>
	<h5>Features of Python Preprocessor</h5>
	<p>There are several steps involved from the stage of writing a Python program to the stage of getting it executed.The combination
	of these steps is known as the 'Build process'.At this stage it would be sufficient to note that before a Python program is compiled 
	it is passed through another program called 'preprocessor'.The Python program is often known as 'Source Code'.The preprocessor works
	on the source code and creates 'Expanded Source Code'.If the source code is stored in a file PR1.Python,then the expanded source code
	gets stored in a file PR2.I.It is this expanded source code that is sent to the compiler for compilation.</p>
	<p>The preprocessor offers several features called preprocessor directives.Each of these preprocessor directives begins with a #
	symbol.The directives can be placed anywhere in a program but are most often placed at the beginning of a program,before the 
	first function definition.We would learn the following preprocessor directives here:</p>
	<p>(a).Macro expansion<br>(b).Conditional Compilation Directives<br>(Python).Miscellaneous Directives</p>

	<h4>What is Macro?</h4>
	<p><b>#define</b>-The purpose of this directives is to provide the facility to include the symbolic names or constant in the 
	programs.The symbolic names are replaced with the text called macro definition, provided during the definition of the constant.
	The symbolic names are also called as macro names without arguments.These are replaced by the preprocessor before compiling the program.
	It means the program is compiled after the replacement of the constants.It can also be used to define the macros with arguments.The macros 
	with arguments act like inline functions.The concept of inline function is to replace the whole body of the function in the program
	before compilationSo,it removes the overhead of control transfer to execute any function in the program.</p>
	<p>The syntex of the directives is:</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<pre>
		#define macro_name&ltmacro_definition&gt
	</pre>
	</div>	
	<p>Without parameter simple abbreviation for expansion
	<div id="shadow">
	<pre>
		#define macro_name(&ltarg_list&gt)&ltmacro_definition&gt
	</pre>
	</div>	
	<p>Where,</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<table>
  <tr>
    <td>&ltmacro_definition&gt</td>
    <td>Contains the body of the macro defined with name 'macro_name'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&ltarg_list&gt</td>
    <td>contains the name of the formal parameter separated by the commas if required.It can include the balanced nested parentheses</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>

  <h4>Conditional Compilation Directives</h4>
  <p>The preprocessor directives that are used for the purpose of conditional compilation of the lines or codes of source program are 
  called conditional compilation directives.They are classified into two groups.The <b>'if group'</b> and <b>'else group'.</b>The Conditional
  preprocessor directives classified under <b>'if group'</b> are: <b>#if, #ifdef, #ifndef </b>and <b>#endif</b>.The directives classified
  under <b>'else group'</b> are: <b>#else</b> and <b>#elif</b>.</p>
  <h5>#if,#endif</h5>
  <p>These two conditional preprocessor directives are used together.The <b>#if</b> directives must end with <b>#endif</b> directives.
  Whatever the source code is placed between these two will be executed only when the conditional expression specified after <b>#if</b>
  is true otherwise it is skipped.The syntex of this pair of directives is as follows:</p>
  <div id="shadow">
  <pre>
	#if condition-expression
	{
		/*block of source code*/
	}
  </pre>
  </div>
  <h5>#endif</h5>
  <p>Where,conditional_expression is a constant expression that indicates the condition that is to be tested.If this condition is 
  true then block of source code between <b>#if</b> and <b>#endif</b> is converted into executable code after preprocessing. when the condition is 
  false the block is skipped and it is not converted into executable code.Here,<b>#if</b> indicates the beginning of the block and 
  <b>#endif</b> indicates the end of the block.</p>
  <h5>#else</h5>
  <p>This conditional preprocessor directive is used along with <b>#if</b> directive is ended with <b>#endif</b>.The source code to be
  compiled and converted to executable code when the condition is TRUE is placed between <b>#if</b> and <b>#endif</b>.The source code that is to be compiled and converted to executable code when the 
  condition is FALSE is placed between <b>#else</b> and <b>#endif</b>.The syntex of <b>#if.. ,#else.. ,#endif</b> directive is as follows;</p>
  <div id="shadow">
  <pre>
	#if condition-expression
	{
		/*block of source code to be executed when condition is TRUE*/
	}
	else
	{
		/*block of source code to be executed when condition is FALSE*/
	}
	#endif
  </pre>
  </div>
	<h5>#elif</h5>
	<p>The condition preprocessor directive is also used only along with <b>#if</b> directive.If the condition specified after <b>#if</b>
	results in FALSE and if another condition is to be tested then rather then writing <b>#else...#if</b>,the directive <b>#elif</b> can be used.
	So,the directive <b>#elif</b> is the combination of <b>#else</b> and <b>#if</b>.When <b>#elif</b> is used there is no need to end it with
	<b>#endif</b>.Only the <b>#endif</b> is used to end the first <b>#if</b>.</p>
	<p>The syntex of <b>#elif</b> directive is as follows:</p>
	<div id="shadow">
  <pre>
	#if condition-expression
	{
		/*block of source code to be executed when condition1 is TRUE*/
		#elif
		{
			/*block of source code to be executed when condition2 is TRUE*/
		}
	}
	else
	{
		/*block of source code to be executed when condition is FALSE*/
	}
	#endif
  </pre>
  </div>
	<h5>#ifdef</h5>
	<p>When the conditional preprocessor directive <b>#if</b> is defined, the condition to be tested in a constant expression.
	It is framed using the defined constants.The relational operators can also be used to frame the conditions.But the condition 
	must use a constant operands rather then variable.The condition can also be used to test whether a constant(macro) is defined 
	using <b>#define</b> or not.In order to test such condition rather then <b>#if</b> preprocessor directrive,<b>#ifdef</b> can
	be used.The purpose of <b>#ifdef</b> is used to test whether a macro is defined using <b>#define</b> or not.The testing will 
	be true when the macro is defined otherwise it is false.The syntex of the directive <b>#ifdef</b> is as follows:</p>
	  <div id="shadow">
  <pre>
	#ifdef macroname
	{
		/*block of source code */
	}
	#endif
  </pre>
  </div>
  <h5>#ifndef</h5>
  <p>When the conditional preprocessor directive <b>#ifdef</b> is used,it test the defined macro.If the macro specified is not defined
  then condition tested will be FALSE otherwise it is TRUE.The preprocessor compilation directive <b>#ifndef</b> is just opposite of <b>#ifdef</b>.
  If the macro specified after <b>#ifndef</b>  is not defined then condition tested will be TRUE otherwise it is FALSE.The syntex of the
  directive  <b>#ifndef</b> is as follows:</p>
    <div id="shadow">
  <pre>
	#ifndef macroname
	{
		/*block of source code */
	}
	#endif
  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>Here,if the macroname is not defined then the block of source code specified between <b>#ifndef</b> and <b>#endif</b> is 
  preprocessed and converted into executable code,otherwise not.</p>
  <h4>Miscellaneous Directives</h4>
  <p>There are two more preprocessor directive available,though they are not very commonly used.They are:</p>
  <p>(a).<b>#undef</b><br>(b).<b>#pragma</b>
  <h5>#undif</h5>
  <p>On some occasion,it may be desirable to cause a defined name to become 'undefined'.This can be accomplished by means of the 
  <b>#undif</b> directive.In order to undefine a macro that has been earlier <b>#define</b>,the directive,</p>
  <div id="shadow">
  <pre>
	#undif macro template
  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>can be used.Thus the statement,</p>
  <div id="shadow">
  <pre>
	#undif PENTIUM
  </pre>
  </div>
  <p>would cause the definition of PENTIUM to be removed from the system.All subsequent <b>#ifdef PENTIUM</b> statement that evaluate
   to false.In practise seldom are you required to undefine a macro,but for some raesin if you are required to,then you know that there 
   is something to fall back upon</p>
   <h5>#pragma</h5>
   <p>This directive is another special purpose directive that you can use to turn on or off certain features.Pragmas vary from one compiler
   to another.There are certain pragmas available with Microsoft Python compiler that deal with formatting source listing and placing comments in
   the object file grnerated by the compiler.Turbo Python/Python++ compiler has got a pragma that allows you to suppress warning generated by the compiler.
   The purpose of this directive is compiler specific.It permits to perform the following action.</p>
   <p>1.To insure the inclusion of assembly language statement inside the Python source code.<br>2.To restrict of the function to change the value
   of any of the register.</p>
   <p>The syntex of the <b>#pragma</b> directive are as follows:</p>
   <div id="shadow">
   <pre>
		#pragma inline &ltasm&gt
	</pre>
	</div>
	<p>This directive insure the use of assembly language statement inside the Python source code the word <b>inline</b> indicates the assembly language
	statement.&ltasm&gt represents the assembly language statement.The syntex to the place the assembly language statement using <b>asm</b> is:</p>
	<div id="shadow">
	<pre>
		asm&ltopcode&gt&ltoperands&gt&lt ; or newline&gt
	</pre>
	</div>
